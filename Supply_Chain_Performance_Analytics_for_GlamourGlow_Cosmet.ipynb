        "#### **1. Inventory Health Across Warehouses and SKUs**  \n",
        "**Objective:** Identify understocked and overstocked products in real time.  \n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "- Use a **heatmap** or **bullet chart** in Tableau to visualize:  \n",
        "  - **Warehouse location** (e.g., East Zone, West Zone).  \n",
        "  - **Product ID/SKU** and **Inventory Gap** (Current Stock - Reorder Point).  \n",
        "- Highlight products below **safety stock levels** (e.g., East Zone warehouse faces recurring shortages).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Insight:**  \n",
        "- Urban warehouses are overstocked, tying up capital, while rural warehouses face stockouts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**  \n",
        "- Implement **predictive restocking** based on demand heatmaps and automate reorder triggers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Order Performance Insights (Delay Hotspots)**  \n",
        "**Objective:** Analyze fulfillment efficiency and late deliveries.  \n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "- **Line chart** for trends in delivery time.  \n",
        "- **KPI cards** for on-time delivery % (e.g., 95% overall but lower in West Region).  \n",
        "- **Geographic map** to pinpoint delay hotspots (e.g., hilly zones, weekends).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Insight:**  \n",
        "- Weekend dispatches and **West Region** have repeat SLA breaches due to last-mile challenges.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**  \n",
        "- Optimize delivery schedules and introduce **dynamic rerouting** for high-risk zones.  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Supplier Benchmarking (Defect Rates & Reliability)**  \n",
        "**Objective:** Compare suppliers by cost, quality, and lead time.  \n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "- **Scatter plot** or **table** with:  \n",
        "  - **X-axis:** Avg. Lead Time.  \n",
        "  - **Y-axis:** Defect Rate.  \n",
        "  - **Bubble size:** Unit Cost.  \n",
        "- Example: **Supplier C** has low cost but high defect rate (high risk).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Insight:**  \n",
        "- Current sourcing prioritizes cost over reliability, increasing rework.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**  \n",
        "- Shift to **high-reliability suppliers** even at slightly higher costs to reduce defects.  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Transportation Route Efficiency & Cost Breakdowns**  \n",
        "**Objective:** Evaluate carriers and routes for cost/service balance.  \n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "- **Bar chart/map** showing:  \n",
        "  - **Carrier performance** (e.g., Carrier B is efficient on southern routes).  \n",
        "  - **Delivery success rate** and **fuel cost**.  \n",
        "- Example: Carrier A incurs peak-season surcharges.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Insight:**  \n",
        "- Hybrid fleet (own + 3PL) adds variability.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**  \n",
        "- Negotiate contracts with **Carrier B** for high-efficiency routes.  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. Unified View of Total Supply Chain Costs**  \n",
        "**Objective:** Visualize cost drivers and seasonal spikes.  \n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "- **Pie chart** for cost breakdown (manufacturing, logistics, returns).  \n",
        "- **Time series** to track seasonal trends (e.g., Q4 return cost spikes).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Insight:**  \n",
        "- Logistics costs surge during promotions; returns inflate margins by ~12%.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**  \n",
        "- Automate alerts for cost spikes and optimize return policies.  \n",
